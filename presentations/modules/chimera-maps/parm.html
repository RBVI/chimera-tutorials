<h2>What does ParM do?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The ParM protein forms filaments that segregates DNA plasmids
prior to cell division.
<li>To partition low copy number DNA plasmids in E coli evenly during
cell division between the two daughter cells, a plasmid is attached to each
end of a growing ParM filament that pushes them to opposite sides of the
mother cell.
<li>ParM filaments look similar to actin filaments.
<li>Filament growth is driven by ATP and filaments have dynamic instability
like microtubles.
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Modeling a ParM Filament</h2>

<ul>
<li>ParM monomers bind ATP and can have the binding cleft open or closed.
<li>We'll build a model of the open state filament with the ATP binding site
empty using x-ray structure
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1MWK">1mwk</a>
and cryoEM map EMDB
<a href="http://emsearch.rutgers.edu/atlas/5129_summary.html">5129</a> (19 Angstroms).
<li>Closed state data is also available: x-ray model
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1MWM">1mwm</a>
and map EMDB
<a href="http://emsearch.rutgers.edu/atlas/5129_summary.html">5128</a>
(17 Angstroms).  Won't have time to look at those.
</ul>

<h2>Analysis Steps</h2>


<h3>Show Molecule and Map</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open PDB 1mwk, EMDB 5129.
<li>Show Command Line (Favorites menu).
<li>Deactivate map (model 0) below command-line to move 1mwk away from map.
<li>Command "rainbow chain" to color two ParM monomers.
<li>Delete chain B.  Use menu Select / Chains / B, then menu Actions / Atoms / Delete.
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Fit Molecule in Map</h3>
<ol start=6>
<li>Fit 1mwk in map.
<li>Move 1mwk into map.
<li>Press Fit button in Fit in Map dialog (volume dialog Tools menu).
<li>Fit using correlation: Fit dialog Options button, enable "Use map
simulated from atoms..." resolution 19.  Press Fit.
<li>Show simulated map (Volume dialog eye icon) as mesh.
<li>Correlation depends on domain of calculation.  Change simulated map threshold and press Update in Fit dialog.
<li>Spend a few minutes trying alternative fit positions.
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Global Fit Search</h3>
<ol start=13>
<li>Search for best fit using 30 tries with command "fit #1 #0 search 30"
<li>Fits appear all along filament, many are equivalent due to symmetry
of the filament.
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Calculate Map Symmetry</h3>
<ol start=15>
<li>Determine map symmetry to eliminate equivalent fits.
<li>Command "measure symmetry #0 helix 20,180,opt minimumCorrelation 0.95".
<li>The "helix" option gives Chimera a hint about helical parameters.
<li>The "minimumCorrelation" option accounts for this unusual map where
the helix does not extend to the edges of the volume box.
<li>View symmetry copies of molecule with command "sym #1 group #0 surf true".
<li>Remove symmetry copies with "~sym #1" (note leading tilde character
which means "undo" in Chimera commands).
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Fit Asymmetric Unit</h3>
<ol start=21>
<li>Clear fit list.
<li>Rerun previous fitting command "fit #1 #0 search 50".
<li>Clear fit list.
<li>Use correlation optimization "fit #1 #0 search 50 res 19".
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Make Filament Model</h3>
<ol start=25>
<li>Show symmetric molecule copies for best fit.
Command "sym #1 group #0 update true".
<li>Color molecules distinctly.  Command "rainbow model".
</ol>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Reduce Molecular Clashes</h3>
<ol start=27>
<li>Inspect clashes between adjacent ParM molecules.
<li>Fit asymmetric unit including all overlapped symmetric molecules.
Command "fit #1 #0 sym true res 19"
<li>Note increased space between molecules.
</ol>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Calculate Predicted Map</h3>
<ol start=30>
<li>Compute difference map between experimental map and predicted map
for molecular model.
<li>First delete extra ParM molecules outside experimental map.
Ctrl-drag mouse to select outside molecules. Press up-arrow key to extend
selection to full molecules.  Menu Actions / Atoms / Delete to delete.
<li>Calculate predicted map.  Command "molmap #1,2, 19"
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Difference Map</h3>
<ol start=33>
<li>Subtract two maps, scaling the second to minimize difference.
Command "vop subtract #0 #3 minRMS true"
<li>Adjust difference map contour level.  Add negative contour with
ctrl-click on histogram.  Adjust contour colors.
<li>Hide molecular models with Model Panel (menu Favorites).
</ol>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Compare "Open" and "Closed" Filaments.</h3>
<ol start=36>
<li>Load "closed" filament (GDP bound), EMDB 5128, menu File / Open...
<li>Flip closed map 180 degrees and fit to open map.
<li>Compute closed map on same grid as open map.
Command "vop resample #5 onGrid #0"
<li>Use Morph Map (Tools menu of volume dialog) to morph between maps.
</ol>
