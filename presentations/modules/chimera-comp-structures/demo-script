demo for Chimera workshop Oct 2012 "structure analysis & comparison"
using Chimera version 1.7 

demo files 
  prefs.class1 - Chimera preferences file to use for this demo
    (Conrad, you will need to edit fetch dir and location of 1hxx.pdb)
  2gbp (PDB, pre-fetched) - E. coli periplasmic binding protein/glucose
  2fw0 (PDB, pre-fetched) - same protein but open/unbound state
  morph.mp4 - H.264 movie previously recorded in Chimera
  1hxx.pdb (PDB local file) - E. coli porin OmpF mutant Y106F
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this session, we'll get into protein structure analysis: 
looking at hydrogen bonds, contacts, and sidechain conformations; 
mapping properties to structures; and comparing different structures.

I plan to present for about 20 minutes.  The demo will cover some important
general concepts and tips for using Chimera, and preview some of the tools 
you will be using in the hands-on part.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can start Chimera by clicking the icon.  For demos, I like to use an
alias that goes to my demo directory and uses a certain set of preferences.

[mac Terminal]%  class1
(alias class1 "cd [file-location]; \cp -f prefs.class1 preferences; [chimera-install-dir]/Chimera.app/Contents/MacOS/chimera")

Recent versions of Chimera start up showing the Rapid Access interface
to recently used data files, etc. [resize window].  Opening any data will
switch to the normal graphics window, but you can toggle in and out of
Rapid Access at any time by clicking the lighting-bolt icon (show).

The window and other startup behaviors can be customized with Preferences, 
which I'll show in a moment. This is uncustomized.

In Chimera, most things can be done with either the menu or commands; 
I'll show examples of both approaches.  Here's the command line:
> Favorites... Command Line

Local files can be opened with File... Open, unsurprisingly enough;
mainly I wanted to show that Chimera knows a huge number of formats. 
A few are for atomic coordinates, but there are also several for
sequence alignments, density maps, etc. (Close).
Fetch by ID allows getting files over the web from various databases 
(explain caching of fetched files; open PDB 2gbp, previously cached).
The "open" command serves both purposes, remote fetching and 
opening local files.

This is glucose-binding protein, dumbbell-shaped with glucose in the middle.
The default initial display is ribbon, with atomic detail near any bound
ligands and ions.  An easy way to show all atoms is with a preset:
> Presets... Interactive 2

First, a brief review of how to move things around.  A mouse is not 
required, but I brought a 3-button mouse and will explain that first.
(functions of mouse 1,2,3; can reassign in Prefs; for single-click mouse or
touchpad, the option,clover keys simulate 2,3 on Mac; other computers similar)
Another way to scale interactively is with the Side View.
> Favorites... Side View  [scale, clip, then turn off clipping]

Holding the cursor over an atom or bond shows info in a "balloon." 
Picking, selection from the graphics window, is done with Ctrl-click 
(pick a protein atom).
The selection is indicated with green outline and reported in the status line.
(hit up arrow to broaden the selection, down arrow to narrow it back down).

There are many other ways to select, such as with the Select menu
(entries in Chain, Chemistry, Residue, Structure; 
atoms are automatically classified as solvent, ligand, etc.).
> Select... Structure... solvent  (now 214 atoms are selected)
When something is selected, the Actions only apply to what is selected.
> Actions... Atoms/Bonds... delete (now nothing is selected)
When nothing is selected, the Actions apply to everything.
> Actions... Atoms/Bonds... hide then show again

You can customize the environment with Preferences.
> Favorites... Preferences  (explain Tools category checkbox columns)
  [set to autostart Command Line, show toolbar icons SideView, FindHBond, 
   Render by Attribute] 
Changes are not saved automatically, so to have them apply to your next
use of Chimera, remember to click Save. [Close preferences]

Next I want to take a closer look at this binding site.
> Select... Structure... ligand  (or Select... Residue... BGC)
> Select... Zone...  [4.0 A, residues]
> Actions... Focus
> Actions... Atoms/Bonds... show only
> Actions... Atoms/Bonds... stick
(Ctrl-click in space to clear the selection)

Often you will want to measure a distance.
Ctrl-click selects one atom. Shift-Ctrl-click adds another atom to the 
selection instead of replacing it, or toggles it back to unselected,
and doubleclick instead of click shows the option to measure distance
(show while talking, e.g., measure distance BGC O6 <-> ASN OD1).
There are less clicky ways to do this. For example, I could have selected
the two atoms and then used the command "distance sel".

*click FindHBond icon
FindHBond uses the atom types, distances, and angles to identify hydrogen
bonds.  The geometric criteria were based on a survey of very
high-resolution small molecule structures, and for structures from the PDB
we typically add tolerances to these cutoffs.
[turn off relax criteria; linewidth 4; explain color wells, change color, OK]

In the command line, tilde stands for "the opposite of" or "not". The
command "distance" could have been used to show the distance, and ~distance
(or ~dist for short, commands can be truncated) can be used to remove
the measurement.
> ~dist
Similarly, although we used the FindHBond GUI, there is a "findhbond" command, 
and these lines can be removed with ~findhbond:
> ~findhb

If you know a command exists but aren't sure of the syntax,
you can show its manual page in a browser using the "help" command.
> help findhbond

The documentation is included with a Chimera download, so you don't need
to be on the web to use it. It can also be accessed from the Help menu or
by clicking Help buttons on the various dialogs.
> Help... User's Guide
There are three main sections, each with its own index: Basic Functions
(also show commands index), Tools, Tutorials (also point out the Quick Ref, 
a 2-page PDF that lists most of the commands).

You can also search for specific terms:
> Help... Search Documentation (search for "element colors")
That gives a series of links and you can click what looks promising
(click the top hit).

Commands are powerful and concise because you can say both
(a) what you want to do and (b) what you want to do it to.
With the menu, you'd have to make the selection, which might take
several steps, perform the action, and then maybe clear the selection 
depending on what you were going to do next.  Examples:
> rep bs :asn
> color yellow :1-100

The Quick Ref includes examples of command-line specification and tables 
that explain the special symbols, : for residue, @ for atom name, etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now for some structure comparison.  We have been looking at the closed,
glucose-bound structure of the protein.  Another structure of this protein
has been solved in the open, unbound state.
> open 2fw0 (example of command-line PDB fetch, but also pre-cached) 

The first structure was opened as model 0 and this one is opened as
model 1 (point out active model numbers below Command Line; structure 
is probably out of view).  
> focus
I'll use a preset to go back to showing the whole proteins as ribbons
in their model colors:
> Presets... Interactive 1 (ribbons)

Obviously the structures are not superimposed; these are just the
coordinates straight from the PDB.
I'll superimpose them with matchmaker, which first aligns the sequences,
then uses the pairing in the sequence alignment to fit the structures.  
I'll use the command, but there is also a graphical interface.
> mm #0 #1
> focus
In this case, aligning the sequences is trivial because these are just
different conformations of the same protein.  Matchmaker also works on 
different but related proteins.  

Next I'll morph between the open and closed conformations.
> start Morph Conformations  
(command line is yet another way to start a tool)
[Add... doubleclick lines to add 1 0 1, Close; 
 set "Action on Create" to "Hide Conformations," click Create]
(use MD Movie to play the morph trajectory in continuous loop)

Morphing creates a trajectory.
This MD Movie tool is also used to view MD trajectories and other ensembles.
The initial display of the morph trajectory mimics that of the input 
structures (mostly just ribbon), but all of the atoms in common are present.  
You could show them all, or some subset:
> disp
> show aromatic
(if asked, could show ligand with: modeldisp #0; ~ribb #0; show ligand)

You can easily record trajectories as a movie
(in MD Movie dialog, pause playback and show File... Record a Movie dialog).

You would probably want to make it look nicer first, for example:
> Presets... Publication 1
and text could be added with 2D Labels (assuming time is limited,
show menu entry under Tools... Utilities, but don't start tool; if
lots of time, show tool and type one label as example, close tool).

Instead of doing the recording now, I'll step over to the oven and get the 
already baked delicious pie...
[in Terminal, open previously recorded movie morph.mp4]

You can save and restore sessions. 
Close Session gets rid of whatever is present and shows Rapid Access.
> File... Close Session
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, I'd like to talk about attributes, properties of atoms and residues.

> from Rapid Access, open 1hxx.pdb
> Presets... Interactive 1 (ribbons)
> ~disp
This is a transmembrane protein, a porin.

*click Render by Attribute icon
Render by Attribute shows histograms of attribute values 
and allows mapping them to visual cues such as color.

Attributes of atoms named bfactor and occupancy were created 
when the input PDB file was read.  I want to color the ribbon, which requires
using an attribute of residues rather than atoms.
[res avg bfactor, Colors; move red to middle, change white to yellow, Apply]
This shows the loops have higher B-factors.

Also assigned automatically for amino acid residues are various torsion
angle values and hydrophobicity on the Kyte-Doolittle scale.
[residue kdHydrophobicity, Worms, Apply]
To show regular ribbons later, it is necessary to render again with 
Worm style = non-worm [OK]

Attributes can also be used in the command line, for example:
> disp :/kdHydrophobicity>4

You can create your own custom attributes by reading in text files
in a simple format; the User's Guide includes several examples.

New attributes are also created by various operations in Chimera. 
For example, showing a surface creates surface area attributes, and
opening an associated sequence alignment assigns conservation values 
to residues. You'll learn more about that in the next session.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

** Quit/restart Chimera or Close session before starting the exercises!! **

- main tutorial: 
Structure Analysis and Comparison (takes at least an hour)

- secondary tutorials (in terms of topic; I doubt there would be time):
Attributes
Model Panel and Ensembles
Trajectory and Ensemble Analysis

These tutorials are included with the Chimera download, so you could do 
them at any time, if not today.  You can get to them from the Help menu.
