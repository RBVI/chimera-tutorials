The pathogenic organism <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> makes a
pigment called staphyloxanthin.  The pigment imparts a golden color 
(hence <i>aureus</i>), but more importantly, contributes to virulence 
by protecting the bacteria from being killed by the host immune system.
The <i>S. aureus</i> enzyme CrtM may be a good drug target 
because it catalyzes a key step in staphyloxanthin synthesis:

We will view and compare different structures of this enzyme.

<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../menu.html#menupresets">preset</a>:
<blockquote>
	<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="cxcmd:open 3w7f">open 3w7f</a></b>

This preset displays the two protein chains (A and B) as red and blue ribbons;
bound molecules and nearby sidechains are shown as sticks.
The two chains are two copies of the enzyme.  Delete chain B:
<blockquote>
	<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<a href="cxcmd:delete /b"><b>delete /b</b></a>
</blockquote>
Move and scale structures 
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../mouse.html">using the mouse</a> and
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../sideview.html#sideview"><b>Side View</b></a> 
as desired throughout the tutorial.
</p><p>
The enzyme combines two 15-carbon molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate
to form a 30-carbon lipid.  This structure contains 
farnesyl <b><i>thio</i></b>pyrophosphate, 
which differs from the substrate by having a sulfur in the place of one
oxygen.  Sulfur atoms are shown in yellow, phosphorus orange, oxygen red, and
nitrogen blue.  Label the ligand residues:
<blockquote>
	<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="cxcmd:label ligand residues">label ligand residues</a></b>
</blockquote>
In this structure, the farnesyl thiopyrophosphate molecules are named FPS.
Three magnesium ions help to offset the negative charges on the phosphates.
The ions are shown as greenish spheres; clicking into the Chimera window
and hovering the mouse cursor over each shows information in a pop-up
balloon.  Metal coordination bonds from FPS, water, and the protein 
are shown with dashed purple lines.
Lines drawn to indicate interactions other than
covalent bonds are called <b><i>pseudobonds</i></b>.
Hovering the cursor over a pseudobond or bond shows balloon information 
about its end atoms and length.
</p><p>
Delete the water, label residues with displayed sidechains, and place the
labels near &alpha;-carbons instead of residue centroids:
<blockquote>
	<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="cxcmd:delete solvent">delete solvent</a></b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="cxcmd:label @@display residues">label @@display residues</a></b>
</blockquote>
Water could be included in the various analyses, 
but is removed here to simplify the tutorial.
</p>

<h3><a href="#top" class="nounder"><b>&larr;</b></a>
<a name="dists">Distances, H-Bonds, Contacts</a></h3>
<p>
It looks like several sidechains could be donating hydrogen bonds
to phosphate oxygens.  (Although the structure does not include
hydrogens, we know they are there!)  
</p><p>
One of the displayed residues is Ser 21.  To measure a distance:
<ol>
<li>Ctrl-click to pick the sidechain oxygen of Ser 21
<li>Shift-Ctrl-doubleclick on the nearest phosphate oxygen
<li>click <b>Show Distance</b> in the resulting context menu
</ol>
Similarly, measure the distance between the sidechain oxygen of Tyr 248
and the same phosphate oxygen. 
</p><p>
The distances seem consistent with hydrogen bonds.  
However, rather than measuring many distances and trying to remember the
appropriate hydrogen-bonding distances for different types of atoms,
just use <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../../ContributedSoftware/findhbond/findhbond.html">
<b>HBond</b></a>.  We will limit the search to H-bonds involving
the FPS residues:
<ol>
<li>Select the FPS residues (for example, with <b>Select... Residue... FPS</b>
	in the menu).</li>
<li>Now, find all H-bonds connecting the ligand (currently selected) to any protein:
<blockquote>
	<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="cxcmd:hbonds sel restrict protein">hbonds sel restrict protein</a></b>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
The H-bonds are shown as pseudobonds of the specified color and line width.
Both measured distances were found to be consistent with hydrogen bonding.
Details can be viewed in the <b>Log</b>, which can be opened by
clicking its <a href="#toolicons">icon</a>.
(In your own work, you may prefer to write the information to a file instead.)
Remove the &ldquo;hydrogen bond&rdquo; pseudobonds:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="cxcmd:~hbond">~hbond</a></b>
</blockquote>
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../../ContributedSoftware/findclash/findclash.html"><b>
Clashes/Contacts</b></a> is similar to <b>HBond</b>
but can also identify nonpolar interactions:
<ul>
<li><b><i>clashes</i></b> 
- unfavorable interactions where atoms are too close together; close contacts
<li><b><i>contacts</i></b> 
- all kinds of direct interactions:
polar and nonpolar, favorable and unfavorable (including clashes)
</ul>
We will identify contacts of the FPS residues:
<ol>
<img src="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../../ContributedSoftware/findclash/findclashicon.png" width="25">
<li>With the FPS residues still selected:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="cxcmd:contacts sel test others reveal true log true select true">contacts sel test others reveal true log true select true</a></b>
</blockquote>
This will show all of the contacts between the selected residues (FPS) and all others and show the side chains.
</li>
</ol>
In the <b>Log</b>, the atom-atom contacts are listed in order of
decreasing VDW <b><i>overlap</i></b>, the amount of 
intersection of atomic van der Waals spheres: 0 if just touching, 
positive if interpenetrating, negative if separated by space.
Slightly separated spheres are still considered contacts by default.
The distances between atomic centers are also given.
</p>

<p>
One might simply want a list of the interacting residues rather than 
the details of each atomic contact.  A list of the selected residues
can be saved in the <b>Log</b>.  First, deselect the ligand residues and ions, 
leaving the protein residues selected:
<blockquote>
	<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="cxcmd:~sel ligand">~sel ligand</a></b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="cxcmd:~sel ions">~sel ions</a></b>
</blockquote>
Then, write the list of selected residues to the log:
<blockquote>
	<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="cxcmd:info residues sel">info residues sel</a></b>
</blockquote>

<h3><a href="#top" class="nounder"><b>&larr;</b></a>
	<a name="angles">Angles, <i>Rotamers</i>, Clashes</a></h3>
<!--
	No way to get angles currently...
<p>
Amino acid torsion angle values can be viewed in the
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../inspection.html"><b>Selection Inspector</b></a>.
Focus on Tyr 248:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../midas/focus.html">focus</a>&nbsp;:248</b>
</blockquote>
Ctrl-click to pick any atom or bond in Tyr 248.  
This will replace (clear) any pre-existing selection.
Open the <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../inspection.html"><b>Selection Inspector</b></a>
again if it is not already open.
Inspecting <b>Residue</b> (instead of <b>Atom</b>)
shows that the sidechain angles chi1 and chi2 in this residue 
are approximately &ndash;107&deg; and &ndash;142&deg;, respectively.
The backbone angles phi and psi are also given.
<b>Close</b> the <b>Selection Inspector</b>.
</p>
-->
<table align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px">

<tr><td><img src="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/clash.png"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
We will set up clash checking and rotate the sidechain interactively.
<ol>
<li>Select residues within 4 &Aring; of Tyr 248:
<blockquote>
	<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="cxcmd:select zone :248 4 residues true">select zone :248 4 residues true</a></b>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Now show the selected residues:
<blockquote>
	<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="cxcmd:show sel">show sel</a></b>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Now, find and show all of the clashes using the clash command:
<blockquote>
	<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="cxcmd:clashes sel test others continuous true">clashes sel test others continuous true</a></b>
</blockquote>
</ol>
No clashes are found in the current position. 
To rotate the sidechain of Tyr 248 interactively:
<ol>
<li>Ctrl-click its CA-CB bond (the stick segment right next to the ribbon)
<li>Enable the <b>Rotate Bond</b> mouse mode (dumbbell with an arrow)
</ol>
Now, the right mouse button will rotate the bond.  (Currently, the angles aren't recorded).
</p>
<!-- NOTE: no way to see the bond angles!!! -->
<p>
Use whichever method you prefer to rotate the bond.
As the sidechain moves, yellow pseudobonds show any clashes, and the
distance monitor updates automatically.
The sidechain is fairly constrained; only chi1 angles of approximately 
&ndash;(100&ndash;120)&deg; avoid clashes if only that bond is rotated.
The sidechain can be frozen in a new position, but for tutorial purposes,
simply restore it to its original position and disable clashes:
<blockquote>
	<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="cxcmd:~clashes">~clashes</a></b>
</blockquote>
</p>

<!-- Add when rotamers are available in ChimeraX
<p>
Next, we will compare the conformation of Tyr 248 in the structure
to tyrosine rotamers from a library.  This will indicate whether
the sidechain is in a frequently observed conformation
and whether other conformations might also fit into the structure.  
</p><p>
With part of Tyr 248 still selected (if not, Ctrl-click to
to select any of its atoms or bonds), start 
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../../ContributedSoftware/rotamers/rotamers.html">
<b>Rotamers</b></a> by clicking its <a href="#toolicons">icon</a>
<img src="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../../ContributedSoftware/rotamers/rotamers-icon.png" width="25">.
Click <b>OK</b> to show <b>TYR</b>
rotamers from the <a href="http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/bbdep2010/" 
target="_blank"><b>Dunbrack 2010</b> backbone-dependent library</a>.
The rotamers are shown in the wire representation and listed in another dialog.
</p><p>
The rotamer dialog reports chi1 and chi2 angles and probabilities
from the library based on the residue's backbone conformation.
Choosing a row (or rows) in the rotamer dialog displays just the 
corresponding rotamer(s).
From the chi angles in the dialog and the 3D display, it is evident
that none of the rotamers match the conformation in the structure.
Other than the backbone angles, 
the probabilities given in the dialog do not take into account any interactions
specific to this structure.  However, the rotamer dialog is integrated
with clash and H-bond detection.  Choose <b>Columns... Add... Clashes</b> 
and click <b>OK</b> to use the default settings; repeat with
<b>Columns... Add... H-Bonds</b>.
</p><p>
The new columns show that each
rotamer forms several clashes but no hydrogen bonds.  
We showed above that Tyr 248 H-bonds with the ligand and avoids clashes, 
which may compensate for its nonrotameric (presumably strained) conformation.
</p><p>
A sidechain can be replaced with a chosen rotamer.
With a single rotamer shown, either click <b>OK</b> in the rotamer dialog
to replace the sidechain with that rotamer and remove the others, 
or simply <b>Close</b> the dialog 
to remove the rotamers without replacing the sidechain.
Although not done in this case, rotamers can be shown for a
different amino acid type than in the structure, allowing
for virtual mutations.
</p><p>
Unlike Tyr 248, Tyr 41 closely resembles the highest-probability tyrosine
rotamer given its backbone angles.  If you like, focus on Tyr 41, 
select one of its atoms or bonds, 
and use <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../../ContributedSoftware/rotamers/rotamers.html">
<b>Rotamers</b></a> to show and evaluate rotamers of tyrosine 
or some other amino acid at that position.
</p><p>
Clear the selection, unlabel the residues, zoom back out, and
remove the distance pseudobonds:

<h3><a href="#top" class="nounder"><b>&larr;</b></a>
<a name="surfaces">Surfaces and Attributes</a></h3>
<p>
FPS and the natural substrate both have a highly polar/charged 
&ldquo;head&rdquo; and a long hydrocarbon &ldquo;tail.&rdquo;
The enzyme pocket is very large and deep,
as needed to accommodate two of these molecules.  
</p><p>
A surface representation is best for showing the shape of the pocket.  
Choose <b>Presets... Interactive 3 (hydrophobicity surface)</b> from the menu 
to display a molecular surface color-coded by amino acid hydrophobicity.
This <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../menu.html#menupresets">preset</a> colors the surface
ranging from dodger blue for the most polar residues to orange red for the 
most hydrophobic, with white in between.
</p><p>
As one might expect, the mouth of the pocket near the phosphates and ions is 
mostly polar, while the rest of the pocket is largely hydrophobic.  
However, the pocket is so deep that it is hard to see when the whole surface 
is shown.  Restricting the surface display to the pocket region allows it 
to be viewed from the outside, as shown in the <a href="#fig3">figure</a>.
</p><p>
Hide the ribbon and the protein atoms, then show only surface near the ligand:

<p>
The <b><a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../midas/sop.html">sop</a></b> 
(&ldquo;surface operations&rdquo;) command
limits the display of surface #0 to a 5.0-&Aring; zone around the ligand 
and shows only the largest resulting fragment.
Without <b>max 1</b>, a few additional disconnected shards of surface
would be shown. If you like, try different cutoff values;
the <a href="#fig3">figure</a> shows results for a cutoff of 4.7 &Aring;.
</p><p>
Amino acid hydrophobicity is one example of an <b><i>attribute</i></b>.
Another attribute commonly used in structure analysis is atomic
B-factor.  B-factor values indicate which parts of the structure
are more or less flexible or disordered.

The <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../../ContributedSoftware/render/render.html#render"><b>Render

and other visual cues.  Choose <b>Tools... Depiction...
Render by Attribute</b> from the menu to start this tool.
The dialog is set to <b>atoms</b> when it appears.  Choose
<b>bfactor</b> from the attribute menu. The B-factor values are shown in a
histogram, and the vertical bars on the histogram define a color mapping.
These bars or <b><i>thresholds</i></b> can be dragged along the histogram 
with the mouse, and their colors can be changed.  Clicking the square
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a> allows changing
the <b>Color</b> of the threshold that was most recently clicked or moved.
The colors can also be changed collectively by choosing a different 
<b>Palette</b> or clicking the button to <b>Reverse threshold colors</b>.
(The <a href="#fig4">figure</a> shows the dialog after a user has added more 
thresholds, chosen the <b>Rainbow</b> palette, and then reversed the colors.)
Adjust the color mapping as desired and <b>Apply</b> it to the structure.
The lowest B-factors are in the protein core, the highest in a loop over
the active site and the C-terminus on the opposite side.
If any sidechain has been replaced with a rotamer, the new atoms will not have 
B-factor values, but they can be assigned a <b>No-value color</b>.
</p><p>
In the <b>Render</b> dialog, switch from <b>atoms</b> to
<b>residues</b> and show the histogram for the attribute
<b>kdHydrophobicity</b>, the
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../midas/hydrophob.html">Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity</a>
of amino acids.  This is the same attribute as used by the surface 
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../menu.html#menupresets">preset</a>,
but different coloring schemes can be applied.
Larger positive values correspond to more hydrophobic residues,
negative values to hydrophilic residues.
The <b>No-value color</b> pertains to residues without Kyte-Doolittle
hydrophobicities, namely any that are not amino acids (such as the ligands
in this structure). The colors can be changed as described above.
Apply coloring by hydrophobicity if you like, then <b>Close</b> the dialog.
</p>

<h3><a href="#top" class="nounder"><b>&larr;</b></a>
<a name="comparison">Superposition and Morphing</a></h3>
<p>
Comparing different structures of a protein is another way to evaluate
flexibility.  We have been viewing a structure bound to substrate analogs,
<b>3w7f</b>.  A structure of the same enzyme without ligands is also available.
Fetch the &ldquo;empty&rdquo; structure and apply the ribbons preset:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../midas/open.html">open</a>&nbsp;2zco</b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../midas/preset.html">preset</a>&nbsp;apply&nbsp;int&nbsp;1</b>
</blockquote>
Now the first structure is tan and the new structure is sky blue, as shown in 
the <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a> 
(<b>Tools... General Controls... Model Panel</b>).  
</p><p>
The structures are in completely different positions, 
so the next step is to superimpose them.  This is easily accomplished with
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../../ContributedSoftware/matchmaker/matchmaker.html"><b>MatchMaker</b></a>
or its <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../midas/mmaker.html">command equivalent</a>:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../midas/mmaker.html">mm</a>&nbsp;#0&nbsp;#1&nbsp;show&nbsp;true</b>
</blockquote>
<b>MatchMaker</b> first generates a sequence alignment using residue types and 
secondary structure (tries to align helix with helix and strand with strand),
then fits the sequence-aligned residues in 3D by pairing their CA atoms.
The <b>show true</b> option displays the sequence alignment.
By default, the fit is iterated so that far-apart pairs are not included 
in the final match.  This allows the most similar parts to superimpose
more tightly and the dissimilar parts to stand out.
Final match statistics are reported in the <b>Log</b>,
and the pairs used in the final fit are shown with light orange boxes
on the sequence alignment. The RMSD histogram
above the sequences shows spatial variability, calculated as the
root-mean-square deviation among the CA atoms of residues associated 
with each column. In this case (only two structures),
the RMSD value is the same as the CA-CA distance.

The structures are highly similar except for the loop at approximately 
residues 52-56; you can see residue numbers by clicking into the
sequence alignment window and hovering the cursor over the corresponding 
one-letter codes.  Click any part of the light orange boxes 
to select all the residues used in the final fit; 
these form the common core, the most conformationally similar parts
of the structures. The selection can be inverted if you want to do something
to the less similar parts, for example:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../midas/select.html#newer">sel</a>&nbsp;invert</b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../midas/display.html">disp</a>&nbsp;sel&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;protein</b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../midas/select.html#newer">~sel</a></b>
</blockquote>
Morphing involves calculating a series of intermediate, interpolated
structures between the original input structures.  In Chimera, the
series of structures is treated as a trajectory that can be replayed,
saved to a coordinate file, or saved as a movie using
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../../ContributedSoftware/movie/framemovie.html"
target="_top"><b>MD Movie</b></a>.
</p><p>
Start the <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../../ContributedSoftware/morph/morph.html">morphing
tool</a>:
<blockquote>
<i>Menu</i>:&nbsp;<b>Tools...&nbsp;Structure&nbsp;Comparison...&nbsp;Morph&nbsp;Conformations</b>
</blockquote>
Click <b>Add...</b> and in the resulting list of models, doubleclick
to choose #0, #1, and #0 again, corresponding to a morph trajectory from the 
ligand-bound structure to the empty structure and back.
<b>Close</b> the model list.
In the main <b>Morph Conformations</b> dialog, set the <b>Action on Create</b>
to <b>hide Conformations</b>, and then click <b>Create</b>.
</p><p>
The progress of the calculation is reported in the
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a>.  
When all the intermediate structures have been calculated, the input 
structures are hidden, the trajectory is opened as a third model (#2), and the
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../../ContributedSoftware/movie/framemovie.html"
target="_top"><b>MD Movie</b></a>
tool appears.  The trajectory can be played continuously or one step
at a time by clicking buttons on the tool, 
or a frame number can be entered directly.
If the <b>MD Movie</b> playback dialog becomes obscured by other windows,
it can be raised using its <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../instances.html">instance
in the <b>Tools</b> menu</a>
(near the bottom of the menu, below the horizontal line).
</p><p>
The initial display of the morph trajectory is as ribbons rather than 
all atoms, but all atoms that are present in both input structures 
are also present in the morph.
Their display can be controlled just as in any other structure, for example:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../midas/display.html">disp</a>&nbsp;#2:52-56</b>
</blockquote>
Ligand residues were only present in one of the structures, so they are
not included in the morph trajectory.  
However, part or all of the original structures can be displayed 
along with the trajectory.  Display of the other models can be re-enabled by
checking the <b>S</b>(hown) boxes in the
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a> (<b>Tools... 
General Controls... Model Panel</b>) or with a command, for example:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../midas/modeldisplay.html">modeldisp</a>&nbsp;#0</b>
</blockquote>
Then, to show only the ligand residues and ions from that model:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../midas/ribbon.html">~ribbon</a>&nbsp;#0</b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>:&nbsp;<b><a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../midas/show.html">show</a>&nbsp;:fps,mg</b>
</blockquote>
In this case, the secondary structure does not change much between the input 
structures. When conformational differences are larger and ribbons
will be displayed, one may want to re-evaluate the secondary structure 
at each step of the trajectory.  That can be done by putting the command
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../midas/ksdssp.html"><b>ksdssp</b></a> in a
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../../ContributedSoftware/movie/movie.html#per-frame">per-frame
Chimera script</a> in
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../../ContributedSoftware/movie/framemovie.html"
target="_top"><b>MD Movie</b></a>.  Such scripts also allow performing
actions (such as showing/hiding a ligand) at specific steps in the
trajectory.

The <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../../ContributedSoftware/morph/morph.html"><b>Morph 
Conformations</b></a> page lists a few additional
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/../../ContributedSoftware/morph/morph.html#examples">example

When finished enjoying the morph trajectory,
choose <b>File... Quit</b> from the menu to exit from Chimera.
